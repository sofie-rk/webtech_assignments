            <p>I am studying Chemical Engineering in my fourth year at NTNU.</p>
            <p>During my studies, I have programmed in Python and C++. This summer, I had an internship where I developed a web application. The front-end was written in JavaScript (React) and the back-end in Python.</p>
            <p>I expect to further develop my front-end skills in this course.</p>

                <li>What is an IP adress? IP (internet protocol) address is a unique numeric identifier assigned to each device on the internet (which uses Internet Protocol for communication). The IP address consits of four parts, and each part is a number between 0 and 255.</li>
                <li>What is DNS? Most Internet host or servers have a domain address in addition to an IP address. This is easier to use and remember since the domain is words and not a unique number. DNS (Domain Name System) maps the domain names to their IP address. In this way, the user can use the domain name instead of the IP address.</li>
                <lI>What is the difference between the Internet and WWW? Internet is a global network of networks, consisting of connected computers and other hardware. WWW (World Wide Web) is where information exchange on the Internet (or by global computer networks). By using a metaphor; if the internet is connecting roads and towns, the WWW will be the thing you see such as trees, cars and houses. </lI>
                <li>Explain what HTML is. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard publishing language by the World Wide Web. It describes the structure of a page, by using elements and tags.</li>
