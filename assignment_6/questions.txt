1) In JavaScript 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 will give false. This is because of the way JavaScript uses decimals and floating point math.
The decimal will be stored as a binary. Binaries are represented in base2, as 0's and 1's. We are used to base10.
Floats with "repeating decimals" cannot be stored "cleanly" in binary. 0.1 can be presented with 1 digit decimal in base10, but not in base2.
This results in the floating point error.

2) The "method"-attribute in a form element specifies how to send the data with (GET or POST).

3) With GET, the form-data is sent as URL variables. The form data is appended into the URL in name/value pairs, which is why the form fields appear in the URL.

4) You should have a validator for the user input in the backend as well in addition to the validator in the front end (HTML5 and/or JavaScript). 
The frontend is available for everyone who can HTML, CSS and JS, and users can therefor easily bypass and send bad data.
The frontend (client side) can be viewed as an "inital, fast check" of the form data.

5) You should use "textarea" over "input" when the user wants to type in more than one line of text. Textarea allows line break in the typed text.
